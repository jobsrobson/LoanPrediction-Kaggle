# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains an experiment using machine learning models to predict bank loan approval. The project was developed as part of a Kaggle competition and achieved a public leaderboard score of **0.94237**.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- GBT Classifier (Gradient Boosted Trees)

## Implementation Details
The dataset used for this experiment includes various features relevant to loan applications, such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and employment status. The models were trained and evaluated using appropriate preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

## Requirements
